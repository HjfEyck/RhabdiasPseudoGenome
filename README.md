# RhabdiasPseudoGenome

This repository contains all the scripts used for the genome assembly of Rhabdias pseudoshpaerocephala, and the subsequent analysis performed on it. This includes the annotation of the mitogenome, nuclear genome, and repeat sequences, as well as the phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses that stemmed from this.
