# Assembling the mtDNA for Rhabdias pseudosphaerocephala

# First I wanted to use raw data that had toad reads removed and no adapters, but had NOT been quality controlled
# mtDNA assemblers seem (from my reading) to usually use truly raw reads, but I did not want to have toad reads in my data, nor adapters
# Chromodorean nematode should have all genes on the same strand of the mitogenome, and this is not true of toads
# so it will probably be easy to spot a wrongly assembled gene  
# To trim the new dataset i used trimmomatic
