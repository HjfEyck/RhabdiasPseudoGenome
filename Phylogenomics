159 (151 genbank, 8 refseq, these are duplicates, will need to remove) reference nematode genome assemblies were taken from NCBI genbank. Only included sequences at the scaffold level or above from the 2010 or newer.

# copy fna files from downloaded species folders and put in single flder for busco 
find ./* -type f -exec cp -n {} . \;

# To parralellize this and save time, I split the 159 genomes into 10 (15-16 genomes per folder) separate folders, then looped busco on each of them

# takes a very long time to run busco on this many

# Next needed an outgroup
# Previously used out groups for neamtoda include kinorhyncha, priaplulida, tardigrada, nematomorpha
# there are no nematomorpha, kinorhyncha, or nematomorpha genomes available
# there are 5 targigrade and 1 priapulida reference genomes available
# Going to try them as an outgroup
# They were downloaded and run against the nematoda_odb10 database, as above.

# My next task was to decide on a cutoff for busco quality. Some of the busco scores of the assemblies were low
# This paper "A Practical Guide to Design and Assess a Phylogenomic Study" indicates a cutoff of 80% could be valid
# However it is known the nematoda_odb10 has some bias towards certain clades, and against tylenchina species, so it makes sense to lower this threshold given that knowledge
# Here I checked and removed the buscos lower than 65% from the directory

#It is also worth noting i cannot apply this 70% cutoff to the outgroup, because it wont have very high scores compared to nematoda_odb10, but is needed for the analysis.
