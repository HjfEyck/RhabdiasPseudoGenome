159 (151 genbank, 8 refseq, these are duplicates, will need to remove) reference nematode genome assemblies were taken from NCBI genbank. Only included sequences at the scaffold level or above from the 2010 or newer.

# copy fna files from downloaded species folders and put in single flder for busco 
find ./* -type f -exec cp -n {} . \;

# To parralellize this and save time, I split the 159 genomes into 10 (15-16 genomes per folder) separate folders, then looped busco on each of them
